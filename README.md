# hello-world
This is a test repository for the guide.

My name is Jesse. I am planning my entry in an IT career. I have little to no programming skills, which kind of makes me nervous. However, I am going to learn as much as I possibly can because I know I will need to know how to code sometime in my career. I am nervous and excited at the same time. Thanks for reading.
